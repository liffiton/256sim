# 256sim

256sim is a CPU simulator for the student-designed ISAs from CS 256 (Computer
Organization and Architecture) at Illinois Wesleyan University.  Each year,
students design a new ISA from scratch (though heavily influenced by MIPS,
which they learn earlier in the semester), design a datapath for it, and
implement their CPU in [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/), in a
simulator (this program) and on physical breadboards.

The simulator can be run via the command-line as ``256sim.py``.
