###
# Tips and Recommendations
###
#
# 1) Create separate methods for fetch, decode, and execute.  Then create separate
#    methods for every different instruction.  Pass the arguments for each instruction
#    into its corresponding method when it is executed.
#
# 2) You can write binary literals in Python with the 0b prefix.  E.g.,  0b01101100
#    Hexadecimal can be written with the 0x prefix.  E.g.,  0x6c
#
# 3) IMEM will contain raw binary machine code.  You will need to decode it carefully.
#    Use bitwise logical operators to mask and extract bits from a single instruction.
#    This can be used to pull separate fields out of a single binary instruction.
#
# 4) Make sure you're clear on what the following are and what they hold / how they work:
#
#      self.PC, self.imem, self.regfile, self.dmem, self.buttons, self.matrix
#
#    Mostly they're arrays.  Look at the reset() method to see how they're initialized.
#    The result of executing any instruction should be that some of these are modified.
#    Ask me for clarification if you're unsure about any of them.
#
# 5) Take it one small step at a time, and test everything you implement before moving on!
